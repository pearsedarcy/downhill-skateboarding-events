# Task 5: Publishing Workflow

## Overview
Integrate the permission system with the event publishing process. Ensure that event creation, editing, and publishing operations respect crew permission settings and provide appropriate feedback to users.

## Components to Build

### 1. Event Model Integration
- **Permission Checking**: Integrate crew permission checks into event operations
- **Event Creation**: Respect `can_create_events` permission for crew events
- **Event Editing**: Respect `can_edit_events` permission for existing events
- **Event Publishing**: Respect `can_publish_events` permission for publication state

### 2. Event Views Enhancement
- **Create Event View**: Add crew permission validation
- **Edit Event View**: Check appropriate crew permissions
- **Publish/Unpublish Actions**: Implement permission-based publishing workflow
- **Permission Feedback**: Clear messaging when users lack permissions

### 3. Template Integration
- **Event Creation Forms**: Show/hide crew selection based on permissions
- **Event Management Buttons**: Display edit/publish buttons based on user permissions
- **Permission Indicators**: Visual indicators of user's event permissions
- **Error Messaging**: Clear feedback when permissions are insufficient

### 4. Crew Event Dashboard
- **Event Listing**: Show events with permission-based action buttons
- **Publishing Status**: Visual indicators of published/draft states
- **Permission Context**: Show what actions user can perform
- **Bulk Operations**: Allow bulk publishing for users with appropriate permissions

## Implementation Plan

1. Enhance event models with crew permission integration
2. Update event views to check crew permissions
3. Modify event templates to show permission-appropriate actions
4. Add crew event dashboard with publishing workflow
5. Test complete publishing workflow with various permission levels

## Integration Points

- **Events App**: Modify event creation and editing views
- **Crews App**: Add event management dashboard to crew detail
- **Permission System**: Integrate with existing crew permission infrastructure
- **User Experience**: Ensure seamless workflow for different permission levels

## Success Criteria

- ✅ Event creation respects crew permissions
- ✅ Event editing checks appropriate permissions
- ✅ Publishing workflow enforces permission requirements
- ✅ Clear feedback for permission-based restrictions
- ✅ Crew event dashboard shows permission-appropriate actions
- ✅ Comprehensive testing across permission levels
