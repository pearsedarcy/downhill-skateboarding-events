- As a crew leader, I want to delegate event creation rights so that other members can organize events
- As a crew member, I want to see crew-specific events and activities on my dashboard
- As an event organizer, I want to create events on behalf of my crew

**Epic Phases/Milestones**:

## Phase 1: Core Crew Management âœ… COMPLETED
- Basic crew CRUD operations
- Membership management
- Basic permissions
- Integration with user profiles

## Phase 2.1: Event-Crew Relationship âœ… COMPLETED
